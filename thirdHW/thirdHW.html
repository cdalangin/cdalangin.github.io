                <p class="desc">Crochet is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of
                    yarn, thread,
                    or
                    strands of other materials. The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning <b>'small hook'</b>.
                    Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic.

                    The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is
                    that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many
                    stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick
                    lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.
