                    Island Hopping is a popular part of any Bohol adventure. Visit Bohol and then go off gallivanting to
                    other islands. That is the best way to see the sights, hear the sounds and feel the warmth of every
                    hospitable Filipino!
                    <br><br>
                    Bohol Island Hopping is easy because Bohol is a strategic link to the Visayas, Mindanao and Luzon.
                    It is part of the Philippine Government’s Strong Republic Nautical Highway or SRNH wherein it is
                    connected to other provinces of the country through RORO, cargo vessels, ferryboats, and fast crafts
                    with the aim of enhancing investment opportunities, agro-industrial development, trade and commerce
                    and tourism pursuits.

            <em>ISLAND HOPPING TOURS</em> usually start at Alona Beach, which is one of the best beaches of Bohol. Make
            sure you arrive early so you can maximize the time that you have. Most tours start at 6 am, just before
            sunrise. If you aren’t able to have some breakfast, you may want to pack some snacks so that you don’t get
            hungry during the tour. You can also consider bringing your own lunch if meals are not included in your tour
            package.<br><br>
            The boat ride from Alona Beach to Balicasag Island takes about 30 minutes. Along the way, you will be
            treated to spinner dolphins showing off on the surface. Your boat driver will get up close to these marine
            creatures, where you will see them somersaulting and accompanying your boat for a few seconds or minutes as
            you traverse the Bohol Sea. It’s an exciting sight to behold as they seem to dance around your boat.

            It’s important to note, however, that there may be instances where dolphins choose to stay below the water,
            especially during certain weather conditions. Don’t worry, though, as Balicasag is home to about 11 species
            of dolphins so the probability of seeing them is quite high in these waters.
