            <p>
                Welcome to Bohol, the friendly heart of the Visayas and one of the most attractive tourist destinations
                in the Philippines. We heartily invite you to come and visit Bohol yourself, and offer you this website
                to help you get a first impression.

                <p class="box-text">Besides a traditional inland tour with a bus or van, you can also enjoy the beauty
                    of the smaller
                    outlying islands and islets of Bohol, by pump-boat. If you are planning to join in on a whale and
                    dolphin watching tour, you can combine this with island-hopping. In order to see dolphins and whales
                    (only if you are lucky and come in the right season!), you'll have to leave early in the morning,
                    sometimes as early as five o'clock, so that you can see a lot of them during their feeding time. The
                    last time we did it, we saw a hundreds of dolphins, playing, jumping, spinning, and swimming next to
                    and under our boat.</p>

                    style of catching fish by surrounding a school of fish with a group of dolphin's, then tightening up
                    the circle until the fish had nowhere else to go and would literally jump into the open mouths of
                    the dolphins.</p>

            <!-- 2 Bold header thing w/ indented paragraph -->
            <h4><em>Tagbilaran City</em></h4>
            <p class="newsfeed-desc">Tagbilaran is the capital of Bohol, and its only city. It is located at the
                south-western end of the
                island. Most boats arrive here, and all scheduled flights land on its one-strip airport, not far from
                the city center. Apart from visiting several shopping malls, such as Bohol Quality, Island City Mall,
                and Plaza Marcela, you dine in various restaurants, visit the Bohol Museum, and a number of interesting
                landmarks, such as the Sandugo blood compact site, which is located in the Bool district of Tagbilaran
                city. This monument is included in most tours, and offers a nice view over the Bohol sea, with Panglao
                island to the right and Pamilacan island a bit farther away to the left.</p>
            <h4><em>Panglao</em></h4>
            <p class="newsfeed-desc">Panglao is both the name of the island south of Bohol, and of the southernmost of
                the two municipalities
                on this island, the other being Dauis, which you will pass through first. The municipality of Panglao is
                home to some of the best known beaches of Bohol, including Doljo beach, Dumaluan beach and Alona beach,
                and has numerous beach resorts. For those curious enough to take a short ride to the town proper -
                easily done on a morning or afternoon, the old town Panglao (known as the poblacion) still preserves the
                traditional layout of a Philippine rural town: A large town-square, covered with grass, with on one side
                the Church, another the town hall, and on a third the local school. Add to this the remnants of an older
                church (of which only one stone wall remains, the remainder of this building was previously made of
                bamboo), and a massive hexagonal watchtower, the largest on Bohol.</p>
