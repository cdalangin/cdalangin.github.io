                    The famed Chocolate Hills of Bohol are not only two but more than 1,268 cone-shaped hills – a very
                    strange geological formation that has baffled a lot of geologists. The hills are spread over an area
                    of
                    50 square kilometers or more and vary in size from 30 meters to 120 meters in height.
                    <br><br>
                    What’s unique with these limestone chocolate hills is that they are only covered in grass and the
                    cone
                    shape is more or less common to all although differing in size. The hills look chocolaty only during
                    dry
                    season when the grass withers and turns into brown and looks like giant chocolate kisses.

            <em>GRASS SPECIES FOUND TO THRIVE ON THE HILLS</em> are Imperata cylindrical and Saccharum spontaneum and
            several
            Compositae and ferns. Trees grow on the base of the hills and are lush and verdant rings around the almost
            bare cone-shaped hills resulting in its awesome natural beauty.<br><br>
            Likewise, the flatlands surrounding the hills are given to rice and corn farming and results in a beautiful
            green backdrop for the Chocolate Hills. Elevation ranges from 100 meters to 500 meters above sea level.
            Higher hills can be found but almost uniform cone-shaped hills are found in Carmen town.<br><br>
            The most acceptable geological theory of the Chocolate Hills of Bohol is that the hills were the result of
            thousands of years of weathering of marine limestone. Others say that the hills were formed ages ago by the
            uplift of coral deposits or that they erupted from the sea in a massive geologic shift, and the action of
            rain water and erosion for the past thousand years put in the finishing touches.<br><br>
            Considered sometimes as the “Eight Wonder of the World”, the Chocolate Hills has been declared as the
            country’s 3rd National Geological Monument by the National Committee on Geological Sciences on June 18, 1988
            in recognition of its special characteristics, scientific importance, uniqueness, and high scenic value; and
            as such is among the country’s protected areas.<br><br>
